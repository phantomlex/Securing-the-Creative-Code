# Securing the Creative Code: An Investigation into the Security Aspects of AI-Generated Code

This repository contains the dataset, analysis scripts, and results for the undergraduate thesis, "Securing the Creative Code: An Investigation into the Security Aspects of AI-Generated Code."

## Overview

The rise of generative AI has revolutionized code creation, offering unprecedented speed and creative potential. However, this transformative technology also presents significant security challenges. This research delves into the intersection of generative AI and software security, exploring the vulnerabilities inherent in AI-generated code. The primary goal is to analyze the security implications of AI-driven code generation and translation by performing a large-scale, multi-tool static analysis.

## Dataset

This study utilizes the **FormAI dataset v1** as its foundation. This dataset was chosen for its large scale and the fact that its vulnerability labels were generated using formal verification (ESBMC), providing a high-fidelity ground truth.

- **Source:** FormAI dataset v1
- **Contents:** 112,000 C programs generated by the GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- **Key Feature:** The dataset contains code generated from a single LLM, allowing for a consistent analysis of one model's security posture.

## Methodology

The research was conducted in a two-phase static analysis experiment:

1.  **Phase 1: C Code Analysis**
    - The original 112,000 C programs from the FormAI v1 dataset were analyzed using **Cppcheck** and **Flawfinder**.
    - The findings were collected to establish a baseline of potential bugs and security weaknesses in the source code.

2.  **Phase 2: AI-Driven Cross-Language Analysis**
    - The entire C codebase was programmatically translated into Python using the **Gemini 2.0 Flash** model.
    - The resulting Python code was then analyzed using a diverse suite of five SAST tools: **Pylint**, **Bandit**, **Semgrep**, **Snyk**, and **Vulnhuntr** (augmented with Gemini 2.0 Flash for hybrid analysis).
    - This phase aimed to investigate how the security landscape of the code changes after automated translation.


## How to Run the Analysis

The complete data analysis, including data cleaning, standardization, and visualization generation, is contained within the `/analysis/ta2.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

To reproduce the analysis, you will need a Python environment with standard data science libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.

**Note:** The scripts for code translation and for the Vulnhuntr analysis require a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to be set up as an environment variable to interface with the Gemini API.
